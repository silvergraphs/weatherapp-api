# Weather App 🌦 (Express API) 

This app shows the weather of any desired location fetching data from the intern API and scraping from OpenWeatherMap.

The app shows:

- Temperature
- Pressure
- Humidity
- Maximum temperature
- Minimum temperature
- Location Map

Temperature data is shown in Metrics units (Celcius).

## Installation 🛠

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run server

```
git clone https://github.com/silvergraphs/weatherapp-api.git

## Important❗

This repository have a React Front end compiled version of the [WeatherApp-Front](https://github.com/silvergraphs/weatherapp-front) in `/app`, the server serves it automatically in the `/` route, and the API is in the `/api` route.

## Used Libraries 📂

I only used `axios` for simplified async data fetching.
